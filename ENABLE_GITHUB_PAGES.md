# 🌐 Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

## ⚠️ Why Site Isn't Opening

GitHub Pages needs to be **manually enabled** in your repository settings.

## 📋 QUICK SETUP (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Settings
The page should already be open, but if not:
👉 https://github.com/Bhanks434/test-repo/settings/pages

### Step 2: Look for "Build and deployment"
You should see a section titled **"Build and deployment"**

### Step 3: Change the Source
- Find the dropdown that currently says:
  - "Deploy from a branch" OR
  - "None" OR  
  - "GitHub Actions"

### Step 4: Select Branch
- **Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
- **Branch**: Select **"main"**
- **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**

### Step 5: Save
- Click **Save**
- GitHub Pages will now be enabled!

## ⏱️ Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will process your request (1-2 minutes)
- You'll see a message: "Your site is ready to be published at..."
- Once it shows ✅, visit: https://Bhanks434.github.io/test-repo/

## 🔄 If That Doesn't Work

Try this alternate method:

### Alternative: Deploy from Branch Folder
1. Go to Settings → Pages again
2. **Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Branch**: "main"
4. **Folder**: "/" (root)
5. **Save**

## 📍 Expected After Enable

You should see:
```
Your site is live at https://Bhanks434.github.io/test-repo/
```

## ✅ Verify It's Working

After enabling, visit:
👉 https://Bhanks434.github.io/test-repo/

You should see:
- ⚡ Tempo Pay logo
