## 🔍 What's In the Build

### CSS Files
- `out/_next/static/chunks/0677fe65d39ad9fb.css` - All Tailwind CSS compiled

### HTML Files
- `out/index.html` - Home page (prerendered)
- `out/cards.html` - Credit cards page
- `out/load.html` - Card loading page
- `out/marketplace.html` - Marketplace page
- `out/404.html` - Not found page

### JavaScript Assets
- Multiple `.js` files for interactivity
- Tailwind utilities and components
- React components bundled and optimized

## ✅ Verification

The CSS styling is now included because:
1. ✅ Next.js build generated all assets
2. ✅ Tailwind CSS compiled properly
3. ✅ Assets exported to `/out/` directory
4. ✅ `.gitignore` updated to include `/out/`
5. ✅ All files committed to GitHub
6. ✅ GitHub Pages now serves the styled pages

## 🚀 Next Steps

### View Your Site
Just visit: **https://Bhanks434.github.io/test-repo/**

### If CSS Still Doesn't Show
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for CDN to refresh
4. Check: https://github.com/Bhanks434/test-repo/actions

### Make Future Updates
```bash
cd /Users/user/Desktop/Tempo
# Make changes to your code...
npm run build  # Build locally
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

## 💡 How This Works

With the build output committed:
1. GitHub Pages directly serves the pre-built HTML
2. No need for GitHub Actions to build
3. Your site is immediately live
